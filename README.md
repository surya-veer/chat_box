# A simple Chat Box for TC 68

Now, this is insane. We could have formed a whatsapp group or a group on hike for sharing things among us. But, people here at IIT Indore's hostel of Silver Springs wanted something of their own. And, so we experimented with making our own chat-box. Anyone, who now browses to the IP of veer-surya's laptop, can send the message. But, anyone outside the cottage or an insider outside the cottage won't be able to send a text on that. 

So, the chat box on local host hence ensures that only the people physically present in real-time inside the cottage are able to text on our own place.

Just Random Things, though. :)
